15010,"move(r2, c0, r0, c3)","move(r4, c2, r3, c2)","To determine the next best move from the given start configuration to the goal configuration, I analyzed the possible moves based on the rules. Here's a brief summary of the reasoning:

- **Start configuration:**
  ```
  Row 0: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  Row 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  Row 2: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  // Block at (2, 0)
  Row 3: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  // Block at (3, 0)
  Row 4: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  // Blocks at (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
  ```

- **Goal configuration:**
  ```
  Row 0: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  Row 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  Row 2: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  // Block at (2, 2)
  Row 3: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  // Block at (3, 2)
  Row 4: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  // Blocks at (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
  ```

- **Movable blocks:** A block can only be moved if the cell directly above it is empty (0). The movable blocks are:
  - At (2, 0) – Above (1, 0) is empty.
  - At (4, 1) – Above (3, 1) is empty.
  - At (4, 2) – Above (3, 2) is empty.

- **Possible moves:** Assuming moves are only to the cell directly above (as per the stacking nature), the options are:
  - Move (2, 0) to (1, 0).
  - Move (4, 1) to (3, 1).
  - Move (4, 2) to (3, 2).

- **Best move:** Among these, moving the block at (4, 2) to (3, 2) is the most direct step toward the goal, as it places a block exactly where one is needed in the goal configuration (at (3, 2)).

The next best move is:

15015,"move(r2, c0, r0, c3)","move(r4, c2, r4, c4)","To determine the next best move from the start state to the goal state, I analyzed the movable blocks based on the rules. In the start state, the blocks are at positions: (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), and (4,2). Only blocks with an empty cell directly above them (i.e., a 0 in the row above, same column) can be moved.

Movable blocks:
- (2,0): Empty above at (1,0).
- (4,1): Empty above at (3,1).
- (4,2): Empty above at (3,2).

The block at (4,1) is already in its goal position, so it should not be moved. Between the other options, moving the block at (4,2) to (4,4) is a good choice because (4,4) is an empty cell in the start state and matches a required position in the goal state.

Thus, the next best move is:

15022,"move(r2, c0, r0, c3)","move(r2, c0, r3, c3)","To determine the next best move from the current state to the goal state, I analyzed the configurations:

**Current State:**
```
Row 0: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Row 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Row 2: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  // Block at (2, 0)
Row 3: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]  // Block at (3, 0)
Row 4: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]  // Blocks at (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
```

**Goal State:**
```
Row 0: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Row 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]  // Block at (3, 3)
Row 4: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  // Blocks at (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
```

### Analysis:
- Blocks that can be moved must have a 0 directly above them (in the row above, same column).
- Movable blocks in the current state: (2, 0), (4, 1), and (4, 2).
- Blocks at (4, 1) and (4, 2) are already in their goal positions, so they should not be moved.
- The block at (2, 0) is not in a goal position. It can be moved to a position that progresses toward the goal, such as (3, 3), which is a required position in the goal state and is currently empty.

### Next Best Move:
Move the block at (2, 0) to (3, 3). This places a block in a position needed for the goal state.

- **Start configuration blocks**: Located at positions (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), and (4,2).
- **Goal configuration blocks**: Located at positions (3,2), (3,4), (4,1), (4,2), and (4,4).
- **Movable blocks**: Only blocks with an empty cell directly above them can be moved. In the start configuration, the movable blocks are at (2,0), (4,1), and (4,2).
- **Blocks already in goal positions**: The blocks at (4,1) and (4,2) are already in their goal positions, so they should not be moved.
- **Next best move**: The block at (2,0) can be moved to a position that progresses toward the goal. Specifically, moving it to (3,2) places a block where one is needed in the goal configuration, freeing up space and allowing further moves (e.g., for the block at (3,0)).

- **Goal state blocks**: (3,1), (3,4), (4,1), (4,2), (4,4)
- **Movable blocks**: Only blocks with a 0 directly above them can be moved. In the start state, the block at (2,0) is movable because the cell above it (1,0) is 0.
- **Valid moves**: A block can only be moved to an empty cell where it can be placed stably—either on the bottom row (row 4) or on top of another block in the same column.

The block at (2,0) can be moved to (3,1), as (3,1) is empty and the cell below it (4,1) has a block, making it a stable position. This move directly places a block where it is needed in the goal state, bringing the configuration closer to the goal.

- **Current State:**
  ```
  [[0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
   [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
   [1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
   [1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
   [1. 1. 1. 0. 0.]]
  ```
  - Movable blocks (those with a 0 directly above them):
    - Block at (2, 0) [row 2, column 0] – Above it (1, 0) is 0.
    - Block at (4, 1) [row 4, column 1] – Above it (3, 1) is 0.
    - Block at (4, 2) [row 4, column 2] – Above it (3, 2) is 0.

- **Goal State:**
  ```
  [[0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
   [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
   [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
   [0. 1. 1. 0. 0.]
   [0. 1. 1. 0. 1.]]
  ```
  - Column 4 needs a block at row 4, which is currently empty.
  - Column 1 and 2 already have blocks at row 4 and need additional blocks at row 3.

- **Best Move Selection:**
  - Moving the block at (2, 0) to column 4 (where it will be placed at row 4) directly addresses the need in the goal state without disrupting existing stacks (e.g., in column 1 or 2).
  - This move places the block at the appropriate position in column 4, as it is the lowest empty row in that column.

- **Goal analysis**: The goal requires blocks at (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), and (4,4). The block at (4,1) is already in its goal position, so it shouldn't be moved unnecessarily.
- **Best move selection**: Among the movable blocks, moving the block at (4,2) to (4,4) places it directly in its final goal position, which advances the state toward the goal efficiently.

- **Start state:**

- Empty cells: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (2,0).
- Possible moves for (1,1): To (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), or (2,0).
- The best move is to (2,0) because it places a block in a position required by the goal state, making progress toward the configuration.

7,"move(r1, c1, r2, c0)","move(r1, c1, r1, c0)","To determine the next best move from the start configuration to reach the goal configuration, let's first summarize the states:

- **Start configuration:**
  ```
  Row 0: [0, 0, 1]
  Row 1: [0, 1, 1]
  Row 2: [0, 1, 1]

- **Goal configuration:**
  ```
  Row 0: [0, 0, 0]
  Row 1: [1, 1, 0]
  Row 2: [1, 1, 1]
  ```

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Identify movable blocks:** A block at position (r, c) can only be moved if the cell directly above it (r-1, c) is empty (0) and r > 0 (since row 0 has no cell above it).
   - Blocks in start: (0,2), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)
   - Check each:
     - (0,2): r=0, no cell above, cannot move.
     - (1,1): Above is (0,1)=0, so it can move.
     - (1,2): Above is (0,2)=1, not empty, cannot move.
     - (2,1): Above is (1,1)=1, not empty, cannot move.
     - (2,2): Above is (1,2)=1, not empty, cannot move.
   - Only the block at (1,1) can be moved.

2. **Determine possible moves for (1,1):** The block can be moved to an empty cell. Empty cells in the start configuration: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (2,0). To reach the goal, prioritize moves that bring the state closer to the goal configuration.
   - In the goal, there is a block at (1,0).
   - Moving the block from (1,1) to (1,0) aligns with the goal state, as it places a block where one is needed.

3. **Select the next best move:** Moving the block from (1,1) to (1,0) is the most direct step toward the goal, as it matches a required position in the goal configuration.

15,"move(r2, c1, r2, c0)","move(r1, c2, r2, c0)","To determine the next best move from the start configuration to the goal configuration, I first identify which blocks can be moved. A block at position (r, c) can only be moved if there is a 0 directly above it (i.e., at (r-1, c), if r > 0).

### Start Configuration:
```
Row 0: [0, 1, 0]
Row 1: [0, 1, 1]
Row 2: [0, 1, 1]
```

### Blocks that can be moved:
- Block at (1, 2): Above it is (0, 2), which is 0, so this block can be moved.
- Other blocks cannot be moved because either they are in row 0 (no space above) or there is no 0 above them.

### Possible new positions:
The block at (1, 2) can be moved to any empty cell (0) in the grid: (0, 0), (0, 2), (1, 0), or (2, 0).

### Goal Configuration:
```
Row 0: [0, 0, 0]
Row 1: [0, 1, 1]
Row 2: [1, 1, 1]
```

To progress toward the goal, moving the block at (1, 2) to (2, 0) is the best option because it places a block in a position needed in the goal state ((2, 0) is 1 in the goal).

 [0. 1. 1.]]
```

**Goal State:**
```
[[0. 1. 0.]
 [1. 1. 0.]
 [1. 1. 0.]]
```

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Identify movable blocks:** A block (1) can only be moved if there is a 0 directly above it (in the row above, same column). Checking the start state:
   - Block at (0, 1): No row above it (row 0 is the top), so it cannot be moved.
   - Block at (1, 1): Above it is (0, 1), which is 1 (not 0), so it cannot be moved.
   - Block at (1, 2): Above it is (0, 2), which is 0, so it can be moved.
   - Block at (2, 1): Above it is (1, 1), which is 1 (not 0), so it cannot be moved.
   - Block at (2, 2): Above it is (1, 2), which is 1 (not 0), so it cannot be moved.

   Only the block at (1, 2) can be moved.

2. **Determine possible new positions:** The block at (1, 2) can be moved to any empty cell (0) in the grid. Empty cells in the start state are at (0, 0), (0, 2), (1, 0), and (2, 0).

3. **Evaluate which move is best:** To reach the goal, we need blocks at (1, 0) and (2, 0), while removing blocks from (1, 2) and (2, 2). Moving the block at (1, 2) to (1, 0) directly places a block where it is needed in the goal state. This move aligns with the goal and may enable subsequent moves (e.g., freeing up space to move other blocks).

   - New state after moving from (1, 2) to (1, 0):
     ```
     [[0. 1. 0.]
      [1. 1. 0.]
      [0. 1. 1.]]
     ```
     This is closer to the goal, as Row 1 now matches the goal's Row 1.

4. **Output the move:** The next best move is from row 1, column 2 to row 1, column 0.

### Analysis:
- Movable blocks: A block at (r, c) can only be moved if the cell directly above it (r-1, c) is 0 or if it is in row 0 (no cell above).
  - Block at (0, 2): In row 0, so it is movable.
  - Block at (1, 2): Above is (0, 2) = 1, so not movable.
  - Block at (2, 0): Above is (1, 0) = 0, so movable.
  - Block at (2, 1): Above is (1, 1) = 0, so movable.
  - Block at (2, 2): Above is (1, 2) = 1, so not movable.
- Possible moves: The block at (0, 2) can be moved to an empty cell, such as (1, 0) or (1, 1), to progress toward the goal (which requires blocks at (1, 0) and (1, 1)).
- Next best move: Moving the block at (0, 2) to (1, 0) sets up the state for subsequent moves to achieve the goal.

### Analysis:
- Movable blocks: A block at (r, c) can only be moved if the cell directly above it (r-1, c) is 0 or if it's in row 0. The movable blocks are at:
  - (2, 0) [since above it at (1, 0) is 0]
  - (1, 1) [since above it at (0, 1) is 0]
  - (1, 2) [since above it at (0, 2) is 0]
- The goal requires blocks at (0, 0) and (1, 0), which are currently empty. To make progress, we should move a block to (1, 0) as it directly addresses a required position in the goal state.
- Among the options, moving the block from (1, 1) to (1, 0) is the best choice because:
  - (1, 1) is movable.
  - (1, 0) is empty, allowing the move.
  - This move places a block where it's needed in the goal, minimizing unnecessary steps.

  - Row 0 (top): [0, 0, 0]

### Analysis:
- Movable blocks: A block at (r, c) can only be moved if there is a 0 directly above it (i.e., at (r-1, c), if r > 0).
  - In the start state:
    - Block at (1, 1): Above is (0, 1) = 0, so movable.
    - Block at (1, 2): Above is (0, 2) = 0, so movable.
    - Block at (2, 0): Above is (1, 0) = 0, so movable.
    - Block at (2, 1): Above is (1, 1) = 1, so not movable.
    - Block at (2, 2): Above is (1, 2) = 1, so not movable.

- The goal requires blocks to be rearranged, particularly to column 0. In the start state, column 0 only has a block at (2, 0), but the goal needs blocks at (0, 0), (1, 0), and (2, 0).
- The best move should bring the state closer to the goal. Moving the block at (1, 2) to (1, 0) achieves this, as it places a block in column 0 where it's needed, and (1, 0) is empty and above a block in column 0.

### Analysis:
- In the start state, the only movable block is at (row 1, column 0) because there is a 0 directly above it (at row 0, column 0).
- This block needs to be moved to help achieve the goal state, where column 0 should be empty, and column 2 should have blocks at row 1 and row 2.
- Column 2 is currently empty, so the block should be placed at the bottom of column 2 (row 2, column 2), as that is the appropriate position for stacking in an empty column.

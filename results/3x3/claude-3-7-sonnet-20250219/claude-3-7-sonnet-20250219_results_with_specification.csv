Since the block at (0,2) has no blocks above it, it can be moved. And the destination at (0,1) is empty, so we can move there.

- The block at (2,2) has a 1 above it, so it cannot be moved
- The block at (0,2) has nothing above it, so it can be moved

To move closer to the goal, I need to:
1. Move the block from the top right (0,2) somewhere else
2. Eventually get a block to the bottom left (2,0)

Looking at the valid moves:
- The block at (0,2) can be moved because it has no blocks above it

Since I can only move blocks that have empty space above them, and only one block at a time, I need to identify which move gets me closer to the goal.

Looking at the rules, I can move a block only if there's a 0 directly above it. In the start state, the blocks in the middle column (positions [1,1] and [2,1]) both have empty spaces above them, so they can be moved.

- The block at (2,2) has blocks above it and cannot be moved
- The block at (1,2) has empty space above it and can be moved

Looking at the starting configuration, I need to move a block that has empty space above it to begin rearranging. The block at position (2,1) [bottom row, middle column] has a block above it, so I can't move it. The block at (2,2) [bottom row, right column] has a block above it, so I can't move that either.

I need to:
1. Move the block from the top row, column 2 (0,2) somewhere else
2. Add a block to the middle row, column 0 (1,0)

Looking at the rules, I can only move a block if there's a 0 above it. The block at (0,2) can't be moved (it's already at the top).

Since the block at (1,2) has a block above it, I can't move it either.

I can move the block from (0,2) to (1,0) which would match the goal state.

- The goal has blocks at (1,0) and (1,1) that aren't in those positions in the start state

I need to move a block from column 2 to column 0 or 1. Since there's a block at (0,2), it's free to move (has no blocks above it).

I need to:
1. Move the block at (0,2) to (0,1)
2. Move the block at (1,2) to (1,0)
3. Remove the block at (2,2)

Looking at the rules, I can only move blocks with empty space above them. Currently, I can move blocks at (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2).

The most direct move is to remove the block at (2,2) since it doesn't belong in the goal state. After that, I'll be able to move other blocks to reach the goal.

Let's analyze the differences:
- Column 0 needs blocks in rows 0, 1, and 2
- Column 1 needs all blocks removed
- Column 2 needs blocks in rows 1 and 2, but not row 0

Looking at the current state, I can see I need to move a block from column 2 row 0 (top-right) since it has no block above it. The best move would be to move it to column 0 row 0 (top-left) which is currently empty.

I need to transform the starting state toward the goal state. I notice:
- I need blocks in the left column (col 0) in all three rows
- I need blocks in the middle column (col 1) in rows 1 and 2
- I need to remove blocks from the right column (col 2) in all rows

Since I can only move blocks that have empty space above them, I can move:
- The block at (2,2) since (1,2) is empty
- The block at (2,1) since (1,1) is empty
- The block at (2,0) since (1,0) is empty

Looking at the goal state, I need more blocks in the left column, so I'll move a block there.

- The bottom row is already correct

I'll check which blocks can be moved according to the rules:
- A block must have a 0 directly above it to be moved
- Only blocks in the middle column (index 1) have 0s above them

Looking at the top two rows in the middle column, I see I need to move one of them to the left column. Since we can only move one block at a time, let's move the top block first:

move 0 1 0 0

This will move the block at row 0, column 1 to row 0, column 0, which starts transforming the state toward our goal."

Comparing the two:
- In the goal state, we need blocks at (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), and (2,1)
- We currently have blocks at (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2)

The differences are:
1. We need to remove the block at (0,1)
2. We need to remove the block at (2,2)
3. We need to add a block at (0,0)

Since we can only move one block at a time, let's look at which block we can move now. Only blocks with a 0 above them can be moved. In the start state:
- The block at (2,0) has (1,0) empty above it
- The block at (2,1) has nothing empty above it
- The block at (2,2) has (1,2) empty above it
- The block at (1,1) has (0,1) occupied above it
- The block at (0,1) has no space above it (top row)

Looking at our goals, we need a block at (0,0). We can move the block from (2,0) to (0,0) since there's a clear path.

I see I need to move blocks to the middle column. I can only move blocks that have no block above them.

The block at (1,0) has a block above at (0,0), so I can't move it yet. But there's no block at (0,0) - I misread. So the block at (1,0) can be moved.

Since there's a 0 above the block at (1,0), I can move it. Looking at the goal state, I need blocks in the middle column.

- In the goal state, we have blocks at (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), and (2,1)

The most immediate difference is that the rightmost column (2) has blocks in the start state but should be empty in the goal state. Also, the middle column (1) is empty in the start state but should have blocks in positions (1,1) and (2,1).

Looking at what moves are possible according to the rules:
- The block at (0,2) can be moved because it has nothing above it
- The block at (1,0) can't be moved because there's a block above it
- The block at (1,2) can't be moved because there's a block above it
- The block at (2,0) can't be moved because there's a block above it
- The block at (2,2) can't be moved because there's a block above it

So, I can only move the block at (0,2). Looking at the goal state, I see I need blocks in column 1, so I'll move this block there.

Wait, I need to reconsider. Let me verify if this is the optimal move:
- Moving (0,2) to (0,1) doesn't align with the goal state, which has (0,0) as a block
- I need to move blocks from column 2 to column 1, and I need to remove a block from column 2 top position

Since I can only move the block at (0,2), and the goal state doesn't have any blocks in position (0,1), I should move it to position (0,0):

- The bottom row is the same [1. 1. 1.]
- In the middle row, the start has [1. 1. 0.] while the goal has [0. 0. 1.]
- In the top row, the start has [0. 0. 0.] while the goal has [0. 0. 1.]

I need to move blocks from the left and middle of the middle row to create a stack in the right column.

Looking at the rules, I can move the block at (1,0) because there's a 0 above it at (0,0).

The best move is:
move 1 0 0 2

This will move the block from the middle row, left column to the top row, right column."
87,"move(r1, c0, r1, c2)","move(r1, c0, r0, c0)","I need to compare the start and goal states to determine the best move.

In the start state:
- Top row (row 0): [0, 0, 0]
- Middle row (row 1): [1, 1, 0]
- Bottom row (row 2): [1, 1, 1]

In the goal state:
- Top row (row 0): [0, 0, 0]
- Middle row (row 1): [0, 1, 1]
- Bottom row (row 2): [1, 1, 1]

The difference is that in the start state, there's a block at position (1,0) that isn't present in the goal state.

According to the rules, I can only move a block if there's a 0 directly above it. The block at (1,0) has a 0 above it at (0,0), so it can be moved.

Since this block doesn't appear in the goal state at all, I need to remove it. Since blocks can only be moved (not removed), the only valid move would be to move this block to the empty space at (1,2).

move 1 0 1 2

However, looking more carefully at the goal state, there's no block at (1,2) either. The goal state has blocks at (1,1) and (1,2) in the middle row. Since the start state already has blocks at (1,1) and also doesn't have a block at (1,2), this doesn't seem right.

Let me recheck the start and goal states. It seems the only difference is that the block at (1,0) in the start state is not present in the goal state. Since we can only move blocks (not remove them), this doesn't seem achievable in one move.

However, since I must provide a move that makes progress toward the goal, I'll move the block at (1,0) to an empty space:

move 1 0 0 0"
88,"move(r0, c2, r2, c1)","move(r1, c0, r0, c1)","I need to transform the start state into the end state. Let me analyze:

Start state:

```

End state:
```
[0. 1. 0.]  (row 0)
[0. 1. 0.]  (row 1)
[1. 1. 1.]  (row 2)
```

Differences:
- In start, position (1,0) has a block, but in end it should be empty
- In start, position (0,1) is empty, but in end it should have a block

I need to move the block at (1,0) to (0,1), which is allowed since there's nothing above (1,0).

move 1 0 0 1"
89,"move(r1, c1, r1, c2)","move(r1, c1, r0, c2)","I need to find a valid move to transform the start state into the end state.

```
[[0. 0. 1.]

```

Looking at the differences:
- There's now a block at position (0,2) in the goal state
- The blocks at (1,1) and (2,1) in the start state are gone in the goal state

Since I can only move one block at a time, and can only move a block if there's nothing above it, let me check which blocks I can move:
- The blocks at (1,0), (1,1), and (2,2) can be moved since they have 0s above them

Looking at the goal state, I need to move a block to (0,2). The most direct approach would be to move a block there directly.

Looking at the possible moves, I can move the block at (1,1) to (0,2).

Therefore, the next best move is:

move 1 1 0 2"

```

 [1. 0. 1.]
 [1. 1. 1.]]
```

Looking at the differences, I can see that in the middle row (row 1), the block at column 1 in the start state should be removed in the goal state.

Since there's a 0 above this block (at row 0, column 1), we can move it according to the rules.

However, looking at the goal state, this block doesn't appear elsewhere - it's just removed. According to the rules, we can only move blocks, not remove them. After moving, the old position becomes 0 and the new position becomes 1.

Since I can only move blocks and not remove them, and there's no place in the goal state where this block should be moved to, this seems to be an invalid operation.

I'll check if I misunderstood something... The block at (1,1) needs to be removed, but the rules state we need to move it somewhere. Since there's no new position for this block in the goal state, I cannot provide a valid move.

Given these constraints, I'll answer:

Looking at the differences:
- In the start state, there's a block at position (2, 2) that's not in the goal state.
- In the goal state, there's a block at position (0, 1) that's not in the start state.

The only valid move is to take the block from position (2, 2) to position (0, 1) since this block has no blocks above it (row 1, column 2 is empty) and the destination position is empty.

Therefore, the move is:

- Bottom row: Need to remove a block at (1,0)

I notice that the block at (1,1) has nothing above it, so it can be moved. The goal state shows we need a block at (0,0). So the best move would be:

Comparing these:

Since we can only move blocks with nothing above them, and we can move a block from (2,2) to (0,0), this is our move:

I need to determine the best move to get closer to the goal state.

Analyzing the differences:

I can only move blocks that have nothing above them. In the start state, I can move:
- The block at (0,1) because it's at the top
- The block at (1,0) because there's nothing above it

Looking at the goal state, I need to move blocks to the right column. Since I need to build the right column and remove from the left, I'll move:

move 1 0 0 2

- The block at (2,0) in the start state needs to be moved
- Two blocks need to be added at (1,2) and (2,2)

Based on the rules, I can only move one block at a time, and it must have an empty space above it. In the start state, the top row has empty spaces above the blocks at (1,0) and (2,0).

The most direct move would be to start moving blocks to the right column where they're needed. Since there's an empty space at position (1,2) and (2,2) in the goal state, I'll move a block there.

- The middle column (1) has too many blocks (2 in current vs 1 in goal)
- The right column (2) needs 2 blocks (0 in current vs 2 in goal)

Since we can only move blocks that have empty space above them, and can only move one block at a time, we should move the top block from the middle column to the right column.

The top block in the middle column is at position (0,1) and we want to move it to (0,2).

2. In the goal state, there's a 1 at position (0, 1)

So I need to move the block from (0, 2) to (0, 1).

According to the rules, I can only move a block if there's a 0 directly above it. In this case, the block at (0, 2) is at the top already, so it can be moved.

- The block at (2,1) remains the same

I need to check if the move from (1,1) to (2,0) is valid:
- The block at (1,1) has a 0 above it at (0,1), so it can be moved
- The destination (2,0) is currently 0, so it can receive a block

- In the goal configuration, there's a block at (2,0) that isn't in the start

Since I can only move a block if there's a 0 above it, I can move the block at (0,2) since it's at the top row.

The best move is to move the block from position (0,2) to position (2,0):

Let me analyze the differences:
1. In the start state, there's a block at (0,2) that needs to be moved
2. In the goal state, there's a block at (2,0) that's not in the start state

Looking at the blocks I can move in the start state:
- The block at (0,2) can be moved because it has empty space above it
- The block at (1,0) can't be moved because there's no block there
- The blocks at (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2) can't be moved because they have blocks above them

Since I need a block at (2,0) in the goal state, and the block at (0,2) needs to be moved, the best move is:

- In the current state, there are blocks at (1,1), (2,1) in the middle column
- In the goal state, these blocks are gone, and instead there are blocks at (1,0), (2,0) in the leftmost column

I need to move blocks from the middle column to the leftmost column. According to the rules, I can only move a block if there's a 0 directly above it.

The top block in the middle column (1,1) has nothing above it, so it can be moved. I'll move it to position (1,0) in the leftmost column.

Comparing the states:
- The top-right block (0,2) in the current state needs to be removed
- A block needs to be added at (1,0) in the goal state
- The middle block (1,1) needs to stay in position

Since I can only move blocks that have nothing above them, I'll check which blocks can be moved:
- The block at (0,2) can be moved (it has nothing above it)
- The block at (1,1) can't be moved (it has nothing above it but we need it in the goal)
- The block at (1,2) can't be moved (it has a block above it)
- The blocks at (2,1) and (2,2) can't be moved (they're at the bottom level)

Looking at the goal, I need a block at (1,0). The block at (0,2) is free to move, so I should move it to (1,0).

I need to determine the best next move to transform the start configuration toward the goal.

Analyzing the differences:
- In the start, there's a block at (0,2) that's not in the goal
- In the goal, there's a block at (1,0) that's not in the start
- The block at (1,2) in the start needs to be moved somewhere else

Looking at my options for valid moves:
- I can move the block at (0,2) since there's nothing above it
- I can move the block at (1,1) since there's nothing above it
- I can't move the block at (1,2) because there's a block above it
- I can't move any blocks in the bottom row as they have blocks above them

The most direct step toward the goal is moving the block at (0,2) to (1,0):

Let me compare what needs to change:
- The block at (0,2) needs to move to (0,1)
- A block needs to be added at (1,0)
- Blocks at (1,2) and (2,2) need to be removed

Looking at the current state, I can only move blocks that have empty space above them. The block at (0,2) has no block above it, so it can be moved.

The best move is to move the block from (0,2) to (0,1):

Comparing the two states:
- In column 0: Goal has blocks at all positions, current has none
- In column 1: Goal has no blocks, current has blocks at rows 1 and 2
- In column 2: Goal has blocks at rows 1 and 2, current has blocks at rows 0, 1, and 2

I can only move blocks that have empty space above them. Looking at the current state:
- The block at (0,2) can be moved (top row)
- The blocks at (1,1) and (1,2) can't be moved as they have blocks above them
- The blocks at (2,1) and (2,2) can be moved if blocks above them are removed first

Since the goal state needs blocks in column 0, and there's a block at (0,2) that can be moved, I'll move it to (0,0):

Looking at the differences:
- In the starting state, column 0 is empty, while in the goal state it should have blocks in all three positions.
- In the starting state, column 1 has blocks in rows 1 and 2, while in the goal state it should only have a block in row 2.
- In the starting state, column 2 has blocks in all three positions, while in the goal state it should only have a block in row 2.

Since I can only move one block at a time and only if there's nothing above it, I need to prioritize blocks that can be moved immediately.

I can immediately move:
- The block at (0,2) since it's at the top
- The block at (1,1) since it has nothing above it

Looking at the goal state, I need to start filling column 0, which is currently empty. The most logical move would be to move the block at (0,2) to (0,0).

Analyzing the differences:

I notice that there's only one difference:
- In the start state, there's a block at position (0,1)
- In the goal state, there's a block at position (0,2)

So we need to move the block from (0,1) to (0,2).

According to the rules, I can only move this block if there's nothing above it. Since it's in the top row, there's nothing above it. The destination (0,2) is empty, so this move is valid.

2. In the goal state, there should be a block at (2,0) which is currently empty

I can see that I need to move the block from position (0,1) to position (2,0).

This move is valid because:
- Position (0,1) has a block (1)
- There is no block above it (it's in the top row)

I need to move a block that has a 0 above it. Looking at the top row of the start configuration, there's nothing above it, so I can move from the top row. The block at (0,2) can be moved.

According to the goal state, I need to place a block at (0,1). So I can move the block from (0,2) to (0,1).

Comparing the two:

- Position (2,1) is 1 in start, 0 in goal

Looking at the rules, we can only move a block if there's a 0 above it. Position (2,1) has a 0 above it in the start state, so we can move that block.

The move would be from (2,1) to (1,0), which is moving the block at the bottom middle to the middle left position.

I need to move the block at (0,2) to (1,0).

Following the rules:
- I can move the block at (0,2) because there's no block above it (it's in the top row)
- The destination (1,0) is empty in the start state

Therefore, the move is:

Comparing the two, I can see that:
- The block at (0,2) and (1,2) in the start configuration need to be removed
- A block needs to be added at (1,0) and (1,1)

Looking at the rules, I can only move a block if there's an empty space above it. Let me examine what's movable:
- The block at (0,2) has nothing above it (it's at the top row), so it can be moved
- The block at (1,2) has a block above it, so it can't be moved yet
- The blocks at (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2) all have blocks above them, so they can't be moved

The block at (0,2) can be moved to (1,0) or (1,1) since both positions are empty and have empty spaces above them.

Since I need to move the block at (0,2) anyway to reach the goal state, and position (1,0) needs a block in the goal state, the best move is:

Looking at the starting configuration, I can see blocks at positions (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2).

Looking at the goal configuration, I need blocks at positions (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), and (2,1).

- In the goal state, there's no block in column 2
- In the goal state, there's a block at (0,1) which isn't in the start state
- In the goal state, there's a block at (1,0) which isn't in the start state

Since I can only move blocks that have an empty space above them, I can move blocks from (0,2), (2,0), or (2,1).

To approach the goal state, I should move a block from column 2 (where we have extra blocks) to either position (0,1) or (1,0).

The most efficient move would be to move the block at (0,2) to (0,1):

Looking at available moves:
- I can move the block at (2,1) since it has an empty space above it at (1,1)
- I can move the block at (2,0) since it has an empty space above it at (1,0)

The block at (2,0) in the start state has an empty space above it at (1,0) and an empty space above that at (0,0), so it can be moved.

The block at (1,1) needs to be moved since that position should be empty in the goal. We can move it to (0,2) or (1,0). Moving it to (0,2) is more direct as that position needs a block in the goal.

- In the goal state, there's a block at position (1, 0) that doesn't appear in the start state

- The block at (1, 2) has a 0 above it

2. The block at (0,1) has nothing above it and needs to be moved
3. The block at (1,1) has a block above it, so it can't be moved

- A block at (1, 0) is present in the goal state but missing in the start state

So I need to move a block from position (2, 2) to position (1, 0).

Since the block at (2, 2) has a 0 above it at (1, 2), it can be moved. The final move is:

Looking at the rules, I can only move a block if there's a 0 above it. Currently, blocks at (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2) have blocks or empty spaces above them.

The block at (2,1) has a block above it at (1,1), so it can't be moved.
The block at (2,0) has an empty space above it at (1,0), so it can be moved.
The block at (2,2) has an empty space above it at (1,2), so it can be moved.

- We need to remove the blocks from positions (0,1) and (1,1)

I notice that the bottom row remains unchanged, and we need to shift blocks from the middle column to the first column.

Since we can only move blocks that have an empty space above them, I'll check what blocks can be moved:
- The block at (0,1) can be moved because there's nothing above it (row 0 is the top)

Since I can only move blocks upward (and only if there's an empty space above), the logical move is to move a block from the bottom row to position (0,0).

Looking at the starting state, I see that position (2,0) has a block and position (1,0) and (0,0) are empty, so I can move this block up to (0,0).

- The block at (2,0) cannot be moved yet because there's a block above it at (1,0)

I notice the column 0 needs a block at the top, and the middle column (column 1) needs to have its block removed.

Since I can only move blocks with no blocks above them, I can move the block at (1,1) to (0,0).

Analyzing the differences:
- In the starting state, we have blocks at (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)
- In the goal state, we have blocks at (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)

The key difference is:
- Block at (1,2) needs to be removed
- Block at (0,0) needs to be added

Since we can only move one block at a time, and blocks can only move if there's a 0 above them, our options are limited to blocks that have no other blocks above them.

In the start configuration:
- We can move the block at (1,0) since there's a 0 above it at (0,0)
- We can move the block at (1,2) since there's a 0 above it at (0,2)

Looking at the goal, we need a block at (0,0), which means we should move a block to that position. The block at (1,0) can be moved to (0,0).

Comparing the configurations:
- Position (0,0): Start has 0, Goal has 1 → We need to add a block here

- Position (1,2): Start has 1, Goal has 0 → We need to remove a block here
- Position (2,2): Start has 1, Goal has 0 → We need to remove a block here

Since we can only move one block at a time, and we can only move a block if there's a 0 above it, let's check which blocks can be moved:
- Position (1,0) has a 0 above it at (0,0)
- Position (1,2) has a 0 above it at (0,2)
- Position (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2) all have blocks above them, so they can't be moved

The most direct move to make progress toward the goal would be to move the block from (1,2) to (0,0):

- The block at (2,0) needs to be removed
- The block at (1,0) needs to be removed
- The block at column 0 is completely gone in the goal state
- The block at (0,2) is added in the goal state

I can currently move any block in the top row (row 1) because they all have empty spaces above them. Looking at the goal state, I need to move a block to position (0,2).

The best move is to take the block at (1,0) and move it to (0,2):

Looking at the differences:
- Need to move a block to (0,1)
- Need to remove blocks from (1,0) and (2,0)
- Need to add a block at (1,2)

Let's check which moves are valid:
- I can move a block if there's a 0 directly above it
- Looking at the top row blocks in the initial state: (1,0) and (1,1) both have empty spaces above them

Since I need a block at (0,1) in the target state, and (1,1) has an empty space above it, I can move the block at (1,1) up.

I need to make changes to reach the goal state. Comparing the two:
- The bottom row [1, 1, 1] is already correct in both states
- In the middle row, we need to change [1, 1, 0] to [0, 0, 1]
- In the top row, we need to change [0, 0, 0] to [0, 0, 1]

I notice that I need to move blocks from the middle row positions (0,1) and (1,1) to create columns (2,0) and (2,1).

Since I can only move blocks that have empty space above them, I can move either block from the middle row. Looking at the goal state, I need to build a stack in column 2, so I'll move a block there first.

Comparing the two configurations, I can see that:
- The only difference is at position (1,0): it's 1 in the start configuration and 0 in the goal configuration.
- This means I need to move the block at (1,0) somewhere else.
- Looking at the goal state, there's no additional block anywhere else, so this block must be removed.

Since we can only move blocks with empty space above them, and the block at (1,0) has empty space above it (0,0), I can move it.

However, there's a problem: I can only move blocks to other positions within the grid, not remove them entirely. Since the goal state has one fewer block, this seems impossible.

Let me re-examine the rules to make sure I understand correctly...

Wait, I need to check if the total number of blocks is the same. Let me count:

Start configuration: 5 blocks (positions (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2))
Goal configuration: 5 blocks (positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2))

I see the issue now. The block that's at (1,0) in the start configuration should be at (1,2) in the goal configuration.

Looking at the differences:
- In the start state, we have blocks at (1,0) and (1,1)
- In the goal state, we have blocks at (0,1) and (1,1)

So we need to:
1. Remove the block at (1,0)
2. Add a block at (0,1)

Since we can only move blocks with empty space above them, I can move the block at position (1,0) to position (0,1).

I need to determine the best move to progress toward the end state.

Comparing the two states:
- We need to move a block to position (0,2)
- We need to remove blocks from (1,1) and (2,1)

First, I check which blocks can be moved according to the rules (blocks with empty space above them):
- Block at (1,0) can be moved (has empty space at (0,0))
- Block at (1,1) can be moved (has empty space at (0,1))
- Block at (2,2) can be moved (has empty space at (1,2) and (0,2))

Looking at the end state, I see we need a block at (0,2). So the most direct move would be to move the block from (2,2) to (0,2).

Looking at the differences:
- In the start configuration, there's a block at position (1, 1)
- In the goal configuration, this position is empty (0)
- All other positions remain the same

The only difference is that the block at (1, 1) in the start configuration needs to be removed.

Since there's a 0 directly above this block (at position (0, 1)), I can move it. According to the goal state, this block isn't relocated elsewhere - it's simply removed.

However, in this puzzle, we can only move blocks, not remove them. Since there's no place in the goal configuration for this extra block, it must be a special case where removal is allowed.

Therefore, the best move would be:

Comparing these two:
1. Position [0,1] is 0 in current but should be 1 in goal
2. Position [2,2] is 1 in current but should be 0 in goal

The only valid move would be to move the block at [2,2] to [0,1], since there are zeros above it allowing for movement.

The only blocks that can be moved right now are those with a 0 above them: the blocks at (1,0), (1,1), and (2,2).

2. Move blocks to the right column (0,2)

The most direct approach would be to start moving blocks to their final positions. Since I need blocks in the right column, and one of the movable blocks is at (1,0), I'll move it to the right column:

move 1 0 0 2

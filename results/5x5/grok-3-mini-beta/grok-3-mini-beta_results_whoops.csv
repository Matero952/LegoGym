- **Start State:**
  ```
  [[0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]
   [0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]
   [0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]
   [0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]
   [0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]]
  ```
  - Blocks (1's) are at positions: (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4).

- **Goal State:**
  ```
  [[0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
   [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
   [0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]
   [0. 0. 0. 1. 1.]
   [0. 0. 0. 1. 1.]]
  ```
  - Blocks (1's) need to be at positions: (2,4), (3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4).

### Analysis:
- Only blocks with a 0 directly above them can be moved. In the start state:
  - The block at (0,4) has no cell above it (it's at the top row), so it can be moved.
  - The blocks at (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), and (4,4) have blocks above them, so they cannot be moved yet.
- The new position must be an empty cell (0) and within the 5x5 grid.
- To make progress toward the goal, we should move the block at (0,4) to a cell that is empty in the start state but occupied in the goal state. The candidates are:
  - (3,3): Empty in start, needs a block in goal.
  - (4,3): Empty in start, needs a block in goal.
- Moving to (3,3) is a good choice because it directly places a block where it's needed in the goal, and it helps free up the stack in column 4 for subsequent moves.

### Next Best Move:
Move the block from (0,4) to (3,3).

  ```
  - Blocks should be at positions: (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3).

- **Rules Check:**
  - Only blocks with a 0 directly above them can be moved. In the start state:
    - The block at (0,4) has no row above it (it's at the top, row 0), so it can be moved.
    - The blocks at (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), and (4,4) have blocks above them, so they cannot be moved.
  - The next best move should bring the state closer to the goal, such as moving a block toward its target position (e.g., from column 4 to column 3).
  - The target cell (0,3) is empty in the start state, so it's a valid move.

The next best move is to relocate the movable block at (0,4) to (0,3), as this directly aligns with the goal configuration.

  Row 4: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  // Blocks at (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
  ```

### Analysis:
- In the current state, the only movable block is at (0, 4) because it is the top block in its column (no block directly above it, or the cell above doesn't exist, making it eligible for movement).
- The goal requires blocks at (4, 2) and (4, 3), which are currently empty. Moving the block from (0, 4) to one of these positions (e.g., (4, 2)) will bring the state closer to the goal.
- After this move, the block at (1, 4) will become the new top block in column 4, allowing further moves in subsequent steps.

### Next Best Move:
The best move is to relocate the block from (0, 4) to (4, 2), as this directly addresses one of the missing blocks in the goal state.

### Analysis:

- In the goal state, blocks are needed at positions: (2,3), (3,3), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4).
- The block at (0,4) in the start state is at the top (row 0), so it can be moved since there is no cell above it to check (or we interpret it as movable per the rules).
- The next best move is to relocate this block to a position that progresses toward the goal. The position (2,3) in the goal state is empty in the start state and matches a required block location.

  ```

### Analysis:
- In the start state, blocks are stacked in column 4 (rows 0 to 4).
- Only the topmost movable block can be moved. A block at (r, c) is movable if the cell directly above it (r-1, c) is 0 or if it is in row 0 (no cell above it).
- In the start state, the block at row 0, column 4 is movable because it is at the top (row 0).
- The goal requires blocks at (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), and (4,4). Specifically, we need to move blocks to column 2 (rows 3 and 4) while adjusting the stack in column 4.
- The next best move involves relocating the movable block at (0,4) to help build the required stack in column 2. The cell at (4,2) is empty and is on the bottom row, making it a valid placement for a new block.

### Next Move:
Move the block from row 0, column 4 to row 4, column 2.

  Row 4: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  // Blocks at (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
  ```

### Analysis:
- In the start state, the only movable block is at (0, 4) because it is in the top row (row 0), and we interpret ""directly above"" as allowing movement for blocks with no row above them (as per the rules' ambiguity, assuming it's possible for the top row).
- The goal state requires blocks to be repositioned, with a block needed at (2, 2).
- The next best move is to relocate the block at (0, 4) to (2, 2), as this directly contributes to achieving the goal configuration. The target cell (2, 2) is empty in the start state, so this move is valid.

  - Blocks are needed at: row 3 column 2, row 3 column 4, row 4 column 1, row 4 column 2, and row 4 column 4.

To reach the goal, we need to disassemble the current stack and reassemble it. The top block at row 0, column 4 can be moved to an empty cell that matches a goal position. A good candidate is row 4, column 1, which is empty in the current state and required in the goal state.

  - Blocks are at positions: (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4).
  - Only the block at (0,4) can be moved, as it is in the top row (no row above it).

- **Goal State:**

### Analysis:
- In the start state, all blocks are stacked in column 4 (from row 0 to row 4).
- In the goal state, blocks are present in column 1 (rows 3 and 4) and column 4 (rows 2, 3, and 4).
- The blocks at row 3 and row 4 in column 4 are already in their goal positions, so we should avoid moving them if possible.
- The top block in the start state is at row 0, column 4. Since there is no row above it (row 0 is the top), it is movable.
- To reach the goal, we need to relocate blocks to column 1. The next logical step is to move the top block (at row 0, column 4) to an empty cell in column 1, specifically row 4 (the bottom), to build toward the required stack.

### Next Best Move:
Move the block from row 0, column 4 to row 4, column 1. This is an empty cell in the start state and aligns with building the stack in column 1 as required by the goal.

- In the goal state, we need blocks on row 4 in columns 1, 2, and 3. The next best move should start building toward this by placing the block in one of these positions.
- The cell at row 4, column 1 is currently empty (0), so it's a valid target.

- The goal requires blocks at (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 4). Specifically, (4, 1) and (4, 2) are on the bottom row, which makes them good candidates for placement.
- I can only move the block to an empty cell. Assuming blocks must be placed on the bottom row (row 4) or on top of another block (to avoid floating), the best option is to move the block from (0, 4) to (4, 1), as this directly contributes to the goal state.

And the goal configuration:

The only movable block in the start configuration is the one at row 4, column 4 (topmost block), as it has no block directly above it.

The next best move is to relocate this block to row 2, column 2, as this position matches a required block location in the goal configuration and is currently empty.

46,"move(r4, c4, r4, c0)","move(r0, c4, r2, c1)","Based on the provided start state and goal state, I'll determine the next best move. Here's a quick summary for clarity:

- **Start State:**
  ```
  Row 0: [0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]  // Block at (0, 4)
  Row 1: [0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]  // Block at (1, 4)
  Row 2: [0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]  // Block at (2, 4)

- **Goal State:**

  Row 0: [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
  Row 1: [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
  Row 2: [0. 1. 0. 0. 0.]  // Block at (2, 1)
  Row 3: [0. 1. 0. 0. 1.]  // Blocks at (3, 1) and (3, 4)
  Row 4: [0. 1. 0. 0. 1.]  // Blocks at (4, 1) and (4, 4)
  ```

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Identify Movable Blocks:**
   - A block at (r, c) can only be moved if there's a 0 directly above it. For a block in row 0, there is no cell above, so it can be moved (assuming this implies it's free).
   - In the start state:
     - Block at (0, 4): No cell above (row 0), so it can be moved.
     - Block at (1, 4): Above is (0, 4), which is 1 (not 0), so it cannot be moved.
     - Block at (2, 4): Above is (1, 4), which is 1, so it cannot be moved.
     - Block at (3, 4): Above is (2, 4), which is 1, so it cannot be moved.
     - Block at (4, 4): Above is (3, 4), which is 1, so it cannot be moved.
   - Therefore, only the block at (0, 4) can be moved.

2. **Determine the Best New Position:**
   - The new position (r_new, c_new) must be an empty cell (0 in the start state).
   - To reach the goal, we want to move the block toward a position that exists in the goal state, such as (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 1), or (4, 4).
   - The cell at (2, 1) is empty in the start state and matches a goal position, so it's a good candidate. Moving here directly contributes to building the goal configuration.

3. **Perform the Move:**
   - Move the block from (0, 4) to (2, 1).
   - After the move: The old position (0, 4) becomes 0, and the new position (2, 1) becomes 1.

49,"move(r4, c4, r2, c1)","move(r0, c4, r4, c1)","To determine the next best move from the start state to reach the goal state, let's first summarize the states:

- **Start State:**
  ```
  [[0, 0, 0, 0, 1],  // Row 0
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],  // Row 1
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],  // Row 2
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],  // Row 3
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]]  // Row 4
  ```
  Blocks are at positions: (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4).

- **Goal State:**
  ```
  [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  // Row 0
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  // Row 1
   [0, 1, 0, 0, 0],  // Row 2 (block at (2,1))
   [0, 1, 0, 0, 0],  // Row 3 (block at (3,1))
   [0, 1, 1, 0, 1]]  // Row 4 (blocks at (4,1), (4,2), (4,4))
  ```
  Blocks are at positions: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,4).

### Analysis:
- Only the block at (0,4) can be moved because it is at the top of its stack (no block directly above it in row -1, which we interpret as movable).
- The goal requires blocks in column 1 (specifically at (4,1), (3,1), and (2,1)). To build this stack, start by placing a block at the bottom of column 1, which is (4,1), as it is empty in the start state.
- Moving the block from (0,4) to (4,1) aligns with the goal, as it places a block where one is needed in the final configuration.

   [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],  // Row 1

   [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],  // Row 3
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]]  // Row 4 (bottom, min row)

  All blocks are stacked in column 4, from row 0 to row 4.

- **Goal State:**

  [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  // Row 0 (top, max row)

   [0, 1, 1, 0, 0],  // Row 3
   [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]]  // Row 4 (bottom, min row)
  ```
  Blocks need to be in columns 1 and 2, specifically in rows 2-4 for column 1 and rows 3-4 for column 2.

### Analysis:
- You can only move a block if there's a 0 directly above it. In the current state, only the block at row 0, column 4 has nothing above it (it's on the top row), so it's the only movable block.
- The goal requires blocks in the lower rows of columns 1 and 2. To build towards this, we should start by moving blocks to their target positions, prioritizing the bottom row (row 4) since stacks are built from the bottom up.
- The best move is to relocate the top block (row 0, column 4) to row 4, column 1, as this aligns with the goal state where row 4, column 1 needs a block.

  This requires blocks in column 1 (rows 1-4) and one block in column 4 (row 4).

- **Movable Blocks:** The top block in the current state is at row 0, column 4. Assuming the rule allows moving a block on the top row (since there's no cell above it), this is the only movable block.

### Analysis:
- According to the rules, I can only move a block if there's a 0 directly above it. In the current state:
  - The block at row 0, column 4 has nothing above it (it's the top row), so it is movable.
  - All other blocks in column 4 (rows 1-4) have a block directly above them, so they cannot be moved yet.
- To reach the goal, we need to relocate blocks from column 4 to column 1.
- The next best move is to move the topmost movable block (at row 0, column 4) to the corresponding position in column 1 (row 0, column 1), as this starts building the stack in the goal location without violating any rules.

  Row 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  Row 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

- **Goal State:**
  ```
  Row 0: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  Row 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
  Row 4: [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  ```
  This has blocks at: row 4 column 0, row 4 column 2, row 4 column 3, row 4 column 4, and row 3 column 4.

### Analysis:
- Only the top block in a stack can be moved, which means for a block at (r, c), the cell directly above it (r-1, c) must be empty (0) or it must be at row 0 (the top row).
- In the start state, the only movable block is at row 0, column 4, as it is at the top of the stack.
- To reach the goal, we need to redistribute blocks from column 4 to other columns at row 4 (e.g., column 0, 2, and 3).
- The next best move should place a block in a position that aligns with the goal state. Specifically, moving the block at row 0, column 4 to row 4, column 0 is a logical step, as row 4, column 0 is empty in the start state and required in the goal state.

### Current State:

Row 0: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]  // Block at (0, 4)
Row 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]  // Block at (1, 4)

Row 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]  // Block at (3, 4)
Row 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]  // Block at (4, 4)
```

- All blocks are stacked in column 4, from row 0 (top) to row 4 (bottom).
- Only the block at (0, 4) can be moved, as it is at the top (row 0), and there is no row above it, satisfying the condition for movement.

### Goal State:
```

Row 4: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]  // Blocks at (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
```

- The goal requires blocks at (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), and (3, 2).
- Currently, all blocks are in column 4, so we need to relocate them.

### Reasoning for Next Move:
- The block at (0, 4) is movable.
- When moving a block to a new column, it should be placed in the lowest available row (i.e., the bottommost empty cell in that column) to build stacks from the bottom up.
- In column 3, the lowest empty row is row 4 (since column 3 is entirely empty).
- Moving the block from (0, 4) to (4, 3) aligns with the goal state, as (4, 3) is a target position.

Thus, the next best move is to relocate the block from (0, 4) to (4, 3).

82,"move(r4, c4, r0, c0)","move(r0, c4, r4, c0)","Based on the provided current state and goal state, I'll determine the next best move. Here's a quick summary:

- **Current State:**
  ```
  [[0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]
   [0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]
   [0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]
   [0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]
   [0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]]
  ```
  - All blocks are in column 4, stacked from row 0 to row 4.

- **Goal State:**
  ```
  [[0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
   [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
   [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
   [0. 1. 0. 0. 0.]
   [1. 1. 0. 1. 1.]]
  ```
  - Blocks are at: (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), and (4, 4).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Identify Movable Blocks:**
   - A block can only be moved if there's a 0 directly above it.
   - In the current state, the block at row 0, column 4 has no cell above it (it's the top row), so it can be moved.
   - All other blocks in column 4 have a block above them, so they cannot be moved yet.

2. **Determine Valid New Positions:**
   - The new position (r_new, c_new) must be empty (0).
   - If r_new is 4 (bottom row), it can be placed directly.
   - If r_new < 4, there must be a block below it in the same column, but in the current state, no such positions exist outside column 4.
   - Possible empty spots on row 4: columns 0, 1, 2, 3 (column 4 is occupied).

3. **Choose the Next Best Move:**
   - To progress toward the goal, prioritize placing blocks where they are needed in the goal state.
   - The goal requires a block at (4, 0), which is currently empty and on the bottom row.
   - Moving the block from (0, 4) to (4, 0) is valid and aligns with the goal.

Thus, the next best move is:

move 0 4 4 0"
83,"move(r4, c4, r0, c0)","move(r0, c4, r4, c0)",move 0 4 4 0
84,"move(r4, c4, r0, c0)", ,"In the given start state:

```
[[0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]]
```

No blocks can be moved because none have a 0 directly above them, as required by the rules. Therefore, no move is possible at this step.

85,"move(r4, c4, r0, c0)", ,"The current state is:

 [0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]]

The goal state is:

In the current state, the only movable block is at position (0, 4), as it is in the top row and has no cell above it.

To progress toward the goal state, which requires blocks at (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), and (3, 1), the block at (0, 4) should be moved to one of the target positions in row 4. Moving it to (4, 0) aligns with the goal and keeps the state progressing.

- **Start State:**

   [0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]

  - All blocks (1s) are stacked in column 4, from row 0 to row 4.

- **Goal State:**
  ```
  [[0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
   [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
   [0. 1. 0. 0. 0.]
   [0. 1. 0. 0. 0.]
   [1. 1. 0. 0. 1.]]
  ```
  - Blocks are at: (row 2, col 1), (row 3, col 1), (row 4, col 0), (row 4, col 1), and (row 4, col 4).

### Analysis:
- **Movable Blocks:** A block can only be moved if there's a 0 directly above it (or if it's at row 0, as there's no row above). In the start state:
  - The block at (row 0, col 4) is at the top, so it can be moved.
  - No other blocks can be moved yet, as they all have blocks above them.

- **Next Best Move:** To progress toward the goal, we should move the top block (at row 0, col 4) to a position that helps build the desired configuration. In the goal, there's a block at (row 2, col 1), and that cell is currently empty in the start state. Moving the block here aligns with creating the stack in column 1, which has multiple blocks in the goal.

Thus, the next move is to relocate the block from (row 0, col 4) to (row 2, col 1).

### Analysis:
- In the current state, blocks are stacked in column 4 (positions: (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)).
- A block can only be moved if there is a 0 directly above it (i.e., the cell at (r-1, c) is empty or out of bounds).
  - The block at (0,4) has no cell above it (row -1 is out of bounds), so it is movable.
  - All other blocks in column 4 have a block above them, so they cannot be moved yet.
- The goal requires blocks at: (3,0), (3,3), (4,0), (4,2), (4,3).
- To progress toward the goal, the movable block at (0,4) should be moved to an empty position that matches a goal location. The best option is to move it to (4,0), as this is on the bottom row and directly matches a goal position.

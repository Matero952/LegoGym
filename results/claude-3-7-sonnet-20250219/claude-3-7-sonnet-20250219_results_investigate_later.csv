Wait - I made a mistake in my indexing. Looking at the arrays again and counting carefully:

Start state has 5 blocks stacked in column 4 (0-indexed).
Goal state needs 4 blocks in column 3 and 1 block in column 4 at the bottom row.

But I need to be careful about the row indexing. Since the top row is row 0, I should move from row 0, column 4 to a new position. The goal shows we need blocks in column 3, starting from the bottom.

For the next best move:
1. I can only move blocks that have an empty space above them

Comparing the two configurations:

- Goal has 2 blocks in column 4 (rows 3 and 4), and 3 blocks in column 2 (rows 2, 3, and 4)

Since I can only move the topmost block in any column (one with a 0 above it), I'll need to move the top block from column 4 to start building the new stack in column 2.

The move would be:
move 0 4 2 2

This takes the block at position (0,4) (top of the rightmost column) and moves it to position (2,2) (middle row, middle column), starting to build the stack in column 2 as shown in the goal state."
